##
## Developers note on SA-4 (1):
##  This control requires that developers of system components, e.g.
##  application servers, to provide a description of the functional
##  properties of the security controls to be deployed.
##
##  A a generally accepted control response is to provide a security
##  configuration guide, such as a NIST National Checklist or DoD
##  STIG, for the component.
##
##  In absense of an approved government configuration baseline,
##  note this requirement is satisfied by a *description* of
##  functional properties. Implimentation details are offered in
##  SA-4(2).

##
## Developers note on SA-4 (2):
##  This control differs from SA-4 (1) in that implementation
##  details are now required. 
##
##  The majority of FedRAMP and FISMA Moderate systems refine this control
##  with the following:
##    - Provide design and implementation regarding security-relevant
##      external system interfaces and high-level design;
##    - Provide design and implementation information required by the
##      SDL process;
##    - Above should be provided with a level of detail sufficient for
##      secure deployment.

##
## Developers note on SA-4 (3):
##  This is most frequently satisfied by demonstrating common criteria
##  certification.
##
##  Lacking Common Criteria certification a detailed outline of SDLC practices
##  is required.

##
## Developers note on SA-4 (4):
##  Note: For software components, such as operating systems, NIST considers it
##  sufficient to provide install-time configuration. For example in RHEL7 a
##  "Security Profile" menu is presented that installs Linux into known government
##  baselines.
