        'The customer will be responsible for analyzing their
        Red Hat Identity Management deployment for
        flaws, reporting on those flaws, and correcting them. A successful
        control response will include a discussion of the process by which
        flaws are discovered and remediated, as well as tools that are used to
        assist in detection and remediation.

        Documentation of the overall process of vulnerability identification to
        patching is forthcoming. This work is being tracked in GitHub:

        'The customer is responsible for ensuring that they employ malicious
        code protection at information system entry, and exit points to detect
        and eradicate malicious code. A successful control response will need
        to address use of code protection mechanisms to protect assets from
        malicious software (i.e. Viruses, malware, rootkits, worms, and
        scripts). In regards to Red Hat Identity Management,
        this is generally through
        integrating third party tools into CI/CD pipelines.

        Documentation and suggested integration procedures are forthcoming.
