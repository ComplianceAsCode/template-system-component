## Developers note on SI-2 (6):
##  Some auditors will request documentation outlining how the component
##  is configured to remove old software/firmware versions.
##
##  For example, software installed on Enterprise Linux distributions
##  generally use the package management of the operating system (e.g. RPM).
##  In such cases, removal of outdated software is handled by the operating
##  system and not the software component itself.
